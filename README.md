# Covid SEA Visualization
## Background
A simple project that visualizing COVID - 19 data. In this case, South East Asia Countries, I would like to show how COVID - 19 journey for each countries. And then, by plotting New confirmed case vs day passed, we can get the idea how well each country at SEA dealing with COVID-19.

### The Dataset
The dataset imported from other github account and the entries update every day.

See : https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

The file already in csv, just needed to imported to python with pandas package. When this project is created, it is 5/28/2020. So the visualization you see stop at 5/28/2020

### Learning Opportunities
In this project, I need to manipulating data to get the desired DataFrame to visualizing the dataand then visualize the data.  Making my own function is needed to get the desired value such as the first day covid 19 occurred for each country.

### Modules
- pandas
- matplotlib

### What to Improve
- COVID - 19 Data is updated everyday. Using API that update the COVID - 19 data everytime we run the code is needed.
- The way I manipulating the table and data are not effective. So many unnecessary code. I need to read more about the function that available and its documentation.
- The visualization its messy, without explanation its hard to interpret. I need to learn how to make less noisy graph and styling my graph more
