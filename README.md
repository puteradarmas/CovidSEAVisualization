# Covid SEA Visualization
A simple project include manipulating data and visualizing data. There's two main visualization that I made. By plotting new confirmed case vs total case we obtain the visualization of COVID-19 Journey at each SEA countries. And by plotting New confirmed case vs day passed, we can compare how well each country at SEA dealing with COVID-19.

# The Dataset
The datasets imported from other github account and the entries update every day. Link to the dataset: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 . The file already in csv, just needed to imported to python with pandas package. When this project updated it is 5/28/2020. So the visualization you see stop at 5/28/2020

# The Visualization
The first visualization we get to see the plot of covid-19 new confirmed cases with the day passed. Every country have different startung point. From this, we can judge how well the SEA countries deal with this pandemic andn compare it to each other. The second plot show New Confirmed Case againts Total Confirmed Case so we can see how Covid-19 journey for each country, straight line's dpwn show that sudden drop of new confirmed case and vice versa.
